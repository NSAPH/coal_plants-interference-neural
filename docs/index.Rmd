The "docs" folder on GitHub is special: if your project is set up to allow this, any files in this folder will appear as a GitHub Pages website. For example, this template is located at https://github.com/djnavarro/newproject, and because I have enabled GitHub pages for this project all the files in this folder are hosted at https://djnavarro.github.io/newproject
